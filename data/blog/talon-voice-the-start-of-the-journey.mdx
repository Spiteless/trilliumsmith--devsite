# Talon voice, a voice based accessability software

Talon Voice is a voice-based accessibility software allowing users to control their computer using their voice. This can be particularly useful for individuals with physical disabilities that prevent them from using traditional input methods like a keyboard or mouse. Talon Voice also offers benefits in shifting one's ability of controlling a computer to away from the desk/chair.

My initial interest in Talon Voice has always had a little bit to do with sloth-like behavior and an obsession to be able to use my computer's full functionality from bed. Before moving to Apple devices, I had an obsession with 2-in-1 tablet PC's, which work great as long as I never needed to use a keyboard or mouse.

I've always been a frequent user of the cellphone voice assistant features, and voice to text transcription, so figuring out a way to use my computer by voice too wasn't that much of a logical leap. Enter: Talon Voice.

## 2021

My first exposure to Talon Voice was via [A Talk by Emily Shae on Voice Driven Development](https://whalequench.club/blog/2019/09/14/strange-loop.html), I was intrigued by the idea of being able to program and practice yoga at the same time. Yoga in my case mostly consisting of Savasana, but it's the thought that counts.

Even after viewing Emily's talk, using Talon was still more of an aspiration. Going from zero exposure to voice-coding to being a fully functional user is a steep journey.

For starters, the whole alphabet has to be relearned:

| Letter | Talon Name 
| ---- | ----  
| A | Air | 
| B | Bat | 
| C | Cap | 
| D | Drum | 
| E | Each | 
| F | Fine | 
| G | Gust | 
| H | Harp | 
| I | Sit | 
| J | Jury | 
| K | Crunch | 
| L | Look | 
| M | Made | 
| N | Near | 
| O | Odd | 
| P | Pit | 
| Q | Quench | 
| R | Red | 
| S | Sun | 
| T | Trap | 
| U | Urge | 
| V | Vest | 
| W | Whale | 
| X | Plex | 
| Y | Yank | 
| Z | Zip | 

Too many words in the English alphabet rhyme with eachother, making voice disambiguation difficult.

```text
Letters with an -ee sound rhyme: 
  B C D E G P T V Z

Letters with an -ay sound rhyme:
  A J K
```
On top of all this, Talon Voice is difficult to use without a halfway decent microphone. My first foray into using Talon used the onboard microphone for my laptop, which wasn't the best.

## 2022

My desire to use Talon has always been paired with getting rid of cords. I'd been hunting for the correct wireless microphone, and my first attempt was:

[Antlion Audio ModMic Wireless Attachable Boom Microphone](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07KQF165L/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
![antilion-mod-mic](/static/images/modmic.jpg)

This worked out _okay_, but was ultimately not a great fit due to my computer setup constantly being moved around. USB-A interfaces are being phased out, so I had to use a dongle to get the USB-A slots for the receiver. Coupled with the need to get both devices into pairing mode before they would connect to my computer, this setup left me wanting something simpler.

## 2023

At this point I had recently purhcased a used MacBook Pro M1 hoping that switching to Apple devices would lessen my headache of getting into software development. I continued to try a few different microphones and accessories:

- [Audio-Technica PRO 92cW-TH](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013UOKB6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) -- First omnidirectional mic
- [Rode Wireless Go II](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08XFQ6KP9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1) -- Wireless pack
- [Powered XLR Female to 3.5mm](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07J5QT23H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) -- For adapting the old microphone port to powered XLR
- [3.5mm Male to XLR Female](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FZJ9325/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) -- To use the line-in port on the Rode

I ended up buying a few other odds and ends here and there, but ulimtately thought I needed an even better microphone due to my audio not recognizing in Talon very well.

# 2024

This is the year that I finally got to actually practice using Talon. I had finally signed a lease and no longer needed to house hop, I got a [Giant TV](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BTTTWHBW/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&psc=1), a used rowing machine, and then I was off to the races!

All the cords accessories felt really cumborsome, and I really wanted to be able to use my voice to navigate my computer and row at the same time. I ended up buying a few more odds and ends like a fanny pack to house all the cables and equipment, but ultimately in a fit of annoyance I just tried the onboard mic the Rode II Go has against a ballcap.

Turns out all that info was incorrect, the only piece of equipment I really needed was the Rode II Go with it's onboard lavalier mic. Just those two simple items were enough to get crackin' as long as the mic is placed in front of your face consistently.

As of now my current set up is:

- Baseball cap
- Rode II Mic
- Binder Clip
- Giant TV
- Row Machine

Nowadays I have become proficient enough in Talon to be able to do things like browse the web ( using an excellent extension called [Rango](https://rango.click/#/) ), and have been steadily working on learning to voice code via [Cursorless](https://www.cursorless.org/).

It's a daily journey, and I am actively working on giving myself better tools to learn the large Talon Community vocabulary that lets all the magic happen.

# What's next

## Quick Start Guide

1. JS (official support) - `npx degit https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog.git` or TS (community support) - `npx degit timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog#typescript`
2. Personalize `siteMetadata.js` (site related information)
3. Modify the content security policy in `next.config.js` if you want to use
 any analytics provider or a commenting solution other than giscus.
4. Personalize `authors/default.md` (main author)
5. Modify `projectsData.ts`
6. Modify `headerNavLinks.ts` to customize navigation links
7. Add blog posts
8. Deploy on Vercel

## Development

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm start
# or
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Extend / Customize

`data/siteMetadata.js` - contains most of the site related information which should be modified for a user's need.

`data/authors/default.md` - default author information (required). Additional authors can be added as files in `data/authors`.

`data/projectsData.js` - data used to generate styled card on the projects page.

`data/headerNavLinks.js` - navigation links.

`data/logo.svg` - replace with your own logo.

`data/blog` - replace with your own blog posts.

`public/static` - store assets such as images and favicons.

`tailwind.config.js` and `css/tailwind.css` - contain the tailwind stylesheet which can be modified to change the overall look and feel of the site.

`css/prism.css` - controls the styles associated with the code blocks. Feel free to customize it and use your preferred prismjs theme e.g. [prism themes](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes).

`components/social-icons` - to add other icons, simply copy an svg file from [Simple Icons](https://simpleicons.org/) and map them in `index.js`. Other icons use [heroicons](https://heroicons.com/).

`components/MDXComponents.js` - pass your own JSX code or React component by specifying it over here. You can then call them directly in the `.mdx` or `.md` file. By default, a custom link and image component is passed.

`layouts` - main templates used in pages.

`pages` - pages to route to. Read the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) for more information.

`next.config.js` - configuration related to Next.js. You need to adapt the Content Security Policy if you want to load scripts, images etc. from other domains.

## Post

## Deploy

**Vercel** 
The easiest way to deploy the template is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com) from the creators of Next.js. Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

**Netlify / GitHub Pages / Firebase etc.** 
As the template uses `next/image` for image optimization, additional configurations have to be made to deploy on other popular static hosting websites like [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). An alternative image optimization provider such as Imgix, Cloudinary or Akamai has to be used. Alternatively, replace the `next/image` component with a standard `<img>` tag. See [`next/image` documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization) for more details.

The API routes used in the newsletter component cannot be used in a static site export. You will need to use a form API endpoint provider and substitute the route in the newsletter component accordingly. Other hosting platforms such as Netlify also offer alternative solutions - please refer to their docs for more information.
