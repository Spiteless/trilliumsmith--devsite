# Easily control your computer from your phone

## Remote Desktop

Google Chrome has a handy dandy featue that easily lets you remote desktop from one device to another. It's aptly named Chrome Remote Desktop, and with the accompanying mobile app for both iPhone and Android, you can add desktop/laptop devices to your Google Profile (connected to an email), and control them from any device logged into Chrome Remote Desktop.

Once you ahve both installed the mobile and desktop app, your computer you intend to share (your desktop in this case) eeds to be configured withini the desktop version of Chrome Remote Desktop. Both these devices need to be logged in with the same Google credentials. You willm be prompted to create a pin number for easier account access, and (at the time of writing) this pin number has to be at least 6 digits.

You will also be asked to create a name for your computer. This name will show up in various versions of the rmote desktop app.

Once that's finished, open up the mobile version of Chrome Remote Desktop, making sure to use the same Google Credentials (I have maybe 4 different Google accounts on my phone...). Your computer's screen should show up at this point, tap the device name, input your pin number,and behold the wonders of somebody else creating a desktop suite for you!

## Remote Desktop and Talon Voice

If you're a Talon Vocie user, there are many differnt avenues to control the mouse location on your computer by voice. If using a touchpad is appropriate for your body mobility level, provided you have a decent internet connection the latency for moving the mouse and seeing the results on a monitor is sufficient.

Voila, you can now use your phone as a touchpad for your computer!
